    review:
      'Outside of tech, I am a singer. I am one of the singers in the Twilight Band, where we bring the magic of 1950s songs and Doo-Wop back to life! Recently, we were honored to be accepted into the Arts Touring Alliance of Albertaâ€™s Alberta Showcase Program, allowing us to share our music with even more people. Join us on our musical journey!',

As a talented showchoir in Edmonton, we come together to perform a wide range of songs, from classics to contemporary hits. Our diverse and dynamic performances are sure to captivate and entertain!',

    review:
      'I also serve at the church! As a member of Divine Friends Choir, I have the privilege of serving at St. Therese Church every Sunday. We also share our music at St. Maria Goretti Church in Devon and Corpus Christi once a month. Our choir brings harmony, hope, and joy to all who listen! It is my vow to be able to serve the Lord through music.',

          While I build in the world of tech during the day, I still find time to enjoy my passion behind the scenes. From singing in a showchoir to performing in bands, I bring creativity to life beyond the screen.
